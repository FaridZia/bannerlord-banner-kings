Pérkenweyd, or 'tree lore', understands that the Great Oak is the source of life and root for the world of mankind. Besides the physical world, a dualistic view of Underworld and the Sacred Canopy separates what is good and bad, righteous and malicious. The Gods perch on the Sacred Canopy, atop the Great Oak, from where they defend and guide the children of the forest, that is, those that adhere to the faith. The children believe that spirits roam this world, and in the grains of oaks they chronicle all that which they witness. Experienced elders claim, however, that also the future may be known through the spirits, and as such are known to delve into divination practices. Moreover, believers argue that being a child of the forest is not a decision one takes, but is, instead, their ancestry. As such, a child of the forest must uphold the Gods, family and ancestry above all else.");
